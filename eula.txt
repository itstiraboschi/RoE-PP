Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this EULA.
Dispute Resolution 
Dispute Resolution. Any Dispute arising with respect to this EULA, the Game, or any related service will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force at the time of delivery of the arbitration notice. 
Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with Hong Kong law with the seat of the arbitration in Hong Kong and the language of the proceedings will be in English. The number of arbitrators will be three (3), with each party nominating one arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the arbitration notice. The appointment of such arbitrators will be confirmed by the HKIAC, and both arbitrators will be instructed to and will agree on the third arbitrator within ten (10) days of their confirmation by the HKIAC. Should either party fail to appoint an arbitrator, or should the two arbitrators fail within ten (10) days to reach agreement on the third arbitrator, such arbitrator(s) will be appointed by the Secretary General of the HKIAC. The arbitrators will award only such damages as are permitted to be awarded pursuant to this EULA. 
Costs. Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees) of any such arbitration; provided, however, that the parties will equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrators. 
Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this EULA, either party may always apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction or any other legal or equitable relief. The parties hereby expressly agree that Sections 5, 6 and 7 of Schedule 2 to the Arbitration Ordinance (Chapter 609 of the Laws of Hong Kong) are to apply.

This EULA does not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of your jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. As noted above, limitations and exclusions of warranties and remedies in this EULA may not apply to you because your jurisdiction may not allow them in your particular circumstance.
